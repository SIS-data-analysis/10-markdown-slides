# Mar 28: IO slides 
### R Markdown for presentations

Our Markdown journey continues as we look at how to create slide decks for presentations. Although you can `knit` to several different types of slide outputs, we'll focus primarily on `ioslide` presentations. The syntax is pretty straightforward. In terms of professional output, the challenge is creating effective presentations. This is more about high-quality visualization, appropriate amount of text, etc.  

## Prep for class
- Some packages you might want:
  - `tinytex`
  - `rmdformats`
  - `xaringan`
- Yihui Xi has great stuff on all things markdown. [Chs 4 and 7 on presentations](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/ioslides-presentation.html) are good for this week.
- *Make sure you have access to your Presentation 1 materials.* We'll work on rebuilding those presentations in markdown.

## Examples for our consideration
- `downcuteEX.html` shows the `downcute` document and serves as a nice bridge from last week to this week
- `xaringanINFO.html` shows the `xaringan` format
- See [my book presentation repository](https://github.com/austin-hart-pols/qualitycontrol) for a customized `xaringan` example.



## Assessment
- Presentation 2: submit electronically via Canvas April 7.
